# Context
The workshop has been delievered within Google Developers Groups (GDG ALgiers) AI Bootcamp by me, the development core team AI responsible

# Content
The workshop introduced Reinforcement Learning, the intuition behind it, the RL framework (Environment, Agent, State, Action, Reward), and different methods of solving RL problems: Value Based Methods (Q-Learning and Deep-Q-Learning) and Policy Based Methods (Policy Gradient)

# Application
- Applying Q-Learning on **Mouse & Cheese** and **Maze** environments, [Github](https://github.com/BrouthenKamel/q-learning)
- Applying Deep-Q-Learning or Deep-Q-Network (DQN) on **Lunar Lander** environment, [Github](https://github.com/BrouthenKamel/lunar-lander)
- Applying Policy Gradient method on **Cart Pole** environment, [Github](https://github.com/BrouthenKamel/cart-pole)
